# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Synchronous code is excecuted in a linear way. Each line of code must complete before the next one starts running. Asynchronous code is exectuded non-linearlly. This means that several functions can be running at the same time. A benefit is that it can run operations that take longer without stopping the rest of the code from running.
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
An event listener is a function that can can listen for specific occurances to happen. This can be used by having a function run after the listener tells the code that a specific occurance happened. 
```

```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Model is responsible for making API calls and handles the communication with data sources.  
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It helps organize code in a way that is more manageble, secure, and modular. It hides information and helps keep internal objects being modified from exernal sources. 
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
