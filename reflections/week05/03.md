## Questions

- Its a technique that helps with time management and a tool for achieving goals.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
- The Two minute rule. Anytime I have something to do infront of me that will take two minutes or less, I'll do it right there.
- Swallow the frog. I'll start by doing the task I dread the most ðŸ˜­. Just to get it over with and feel more confident that I'll get everything else done.
- Break Parkinsonâ€™s law. I'll try to be more realistic on how long task take me. And try giving less time to complete a task.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
