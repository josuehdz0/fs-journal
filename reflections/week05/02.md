## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
- One to one, One-to-many, many-to-many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
- A benefit of linking in a 1:N is that the 'N' doesnt add to the original '1' document. Making it less likely that the original document stays under the max document size. It also helps with pagination by making it easier to slice through comments.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
- The scale of how many relationships you will have can effect how you create it. Also how flexible you want it to be to make changes in the long term.
