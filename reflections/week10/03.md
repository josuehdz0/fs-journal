## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
- A row is a new object, while a column is a property of the object.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- CREATE TABLE characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
- Delete From table deletes one or more existing records from the table in the database. Drop drops the complete table from the database.
