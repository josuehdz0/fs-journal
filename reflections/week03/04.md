> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
- I solves the issue of keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data.
- Helps your code become more reusable and scalable.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
- The subject, the observer, and the notification.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
- I am not sure on this one. Maybe its the event emitter? And everytime 'a' happens, it tells 'b' to run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- The group assignment definately took longer than usual. This was because I was leading my partner more than usual. But this did force me to really understand what I was doing and really learn when we were stuck. I still enjoyed it.
