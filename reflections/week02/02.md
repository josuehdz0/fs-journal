## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- A function Decleration - this is hoisted, so can be used before its defined.
- A Function Expression - anonymous function. Is no hoisted, and cannot be used before they are defined.
- An arrow function - shorter syntax function that do not create there own "this"?

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- Parameter are names created in the function and are seperated by commas in the () of a function. ex: function(parameter)
- Arguments are the values the function recieves from each parameter when the function is executed/invoked. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- Higher order functions are when a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function. Examples: Array.prototype.map and array.prototype.filter. I still am having trouble understanding this.
