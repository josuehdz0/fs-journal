# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - I think I was slowly able to retain information about Javascript throughout the week. Still have much to learn, but its coming along.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  - I still am very suprised how much detail you need to give a computer for it to do a task that would seem simple. 

- What are you struggling with?
  - I still struggle a little bit with the syntax and remembering how to write things like forloops, ifs, and foreach statements. It's hard for me not to do it without reference in previous classes.

- What would you count as a victory?
  - I suprised myself with completing this next checkpoint this weekend. It was a struggle, but i think i did well and learned a lot.
