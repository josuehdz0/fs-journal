## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
- I really like reducing the opacity of white text since you never really have to match the exact color of whats behind. It propbably would work over any color besides whites.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
- The Cheating at Design is a good start. Finding websites that I enjoy navigating through and are asthetically pleasing. Bootstraps documentation also has examples that are easy to add.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
- A great website is one that lets its user feel comfortable and curious. Good design helps guide a users experience in a way that feels like they can find what they are looking for and even find something they didnt know they were looking for. 
- Design creates emotion. Its up to the designer to decide what emotional experience they want the user to have.
