## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
- The purpose of a wireframe is to have a quick two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or web app so everyone can agree on what a website should look like before its written in code.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- Low-Fidelity: Basic sketches of website or app that show a good staring point for a complete wireframe.

- Mid-Fidelity: A little more detail is given here with applications like Sketch showing a black and white framework that gives more clarity on what the final site will look like. Still lacking color, accurate fonts, and accurate text.

- High Fidelity: This is the pixel-specific layout that shows every detail of what the website is going to look like before coding begins. Figma is a tool that can create these wireframes for developers to use as the reference for what they will build.


3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
- Yes, 100%.
  - Time: Yes, it saves more time since you know what youre developing from the start. So you dont waste time designing with the limitations of Html and css (even with bootstrap).
  - Energy: The more time you spend on designing, the more energy you waste.
  - Effort: Small effort designing with wire-frames saves you time and energy.
- When building a website/app without a wire-frame, there is no structure to what you are creating. Sure it may be fun, but a website should always have a specific goal. It's like holding a paintbrush infront of canvas and not knowing what you're going to paint.
