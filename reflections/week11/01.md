## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
- Inheritance is a mechanism tha allows the developer to describe a relationship between two classes.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
- When you derive a class from a base class using inheritance, the derived class inherits all the members of the base class. Not all members of the base class are inherited the same way. Public, protected, and private members react differently.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
- Each type of member is effected differently. 
  - Public: accessable to all code
  - Protected: accessable to the class that defines them and to any other classes that are derived from that class
  - Private: only accesable to the class that defines them.
