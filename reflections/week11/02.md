## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
- A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in that table.
- A foreign key refers to the primary key from another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?
- An alias is a way of writing sql terms short handed. To condense your code. Like rp for recipe, or st for student.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

- Im assuming that the last table is incorrect in being called doctors? Maybe is should be called appointments?

SELECT patients.*
FROM doctors
JOIN appointments ON doctors.id = appointments.doctorId
JOIN patients ON appointments.patientId = patients.id
WHERE doctors.id = [doctor_id];
