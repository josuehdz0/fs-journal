## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- The course was what I was looking for. I cant believe that it is almost over. I also cannot believe how much I've learned and accomplished these past few weeks. I will say that my biggest struggle was Capstone week. As the product owner, it was clear that my team wasnt as passionate about the application as I was and as a team of 5, it was pretty difficult to end up coding together. After capstone week, I did become a little discouraged since we didnt really accomplish the goals we thought we could. But working on allspice and atleast finishing the backend with C#, it made me feel a little better about passing the final. My concerns are in front end for the final, since its been over 3 weeks since I've completely finished the front end of a project. But I got this. I know I can do it. I'm planning on sitting and writing down what I want to accomplish each day for this next week of the final.
