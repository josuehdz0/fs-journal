## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
- I spent quite a bit of time with UX on this weeks checkpoint. Most of the requirements revolved around good UX, but it was definately satisfying when I was able to make each little thing work. 

2. What went well this week?
- Didnt think it was possible, but i got my duck ðŸ¥¹. I learned many things along the way.

3. What would you do differently?
- I think I would maybe write down what I'd like to get done within a certain time. And ask for help sooner.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- This weeks checkpoint taught me to take big projects one step at a time. If you split up large goals into smaller steps, its a lot less intimidating and doable.
