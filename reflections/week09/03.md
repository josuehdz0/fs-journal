## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
- Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format. So a Base64 Encoded Image is an image that has been encoded to binary. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
- Base64 encoding an image does not compress an image. The process of encoding an image actually increases the file size by more than 25% which increases bandwidth use and download time. Also increases CPU overhead to decode the image and causes caching issues. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
- Back then, web browsers had heavy limits on the number of concurrent conections they could send to a server. So they had to limit what was being sent per connection, thus sending encoded images. With the introduction of multiplexing (HTTP/2), web browsers became effecient in delivering hundreds of files theough a single connection.
