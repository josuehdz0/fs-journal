## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
- We are using Spotifys API, javascript, bootstrap css, html, git, and nodejs. We are using SOLID principles as well as partner programming.

2. What went well so far?
- Designation of roles has helped the group move forward aswell as understand who to reach out to in the group when a specific problem arises. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?
- I wish we would have planned more. Even down to the function of what is needed for every user function that will be needed. Trello board should have been organized more than it should have.
