## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Unit Testing
  - Tests smaller units of code in isolation. Ensures each unit of code works properly

- Component Testing
  - Test each component when mounted to the DOM. 

- End-to-End Testing
  - Testing the entire application to make sure the user has the expected experience. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- E2E. All test seem important. But they seem to all be used so that the final E2E testing is successful.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- Component testing? It seems repetative if youre doing unit testing.
